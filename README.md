# SNEAKER - APP

Description: The sneakers app is an amazing social platform to share your sneaker collection! In this app you can create and name your own collection as well as add sneakers to a database. The only catch is that you must be signed in using google! Otherwise, feel free to view the collections feed where other users collections are!
